Test best practices
=========================

Organising tests
========================
1. It's a good practice to organising tests
2. We can put the tests in a directory named tests. If the directory doesn't exixt in our project we can create it and jest will automatically find it.
3.Each file with the name *.test.ts is referred to a test suite ans each of such a file should be moved to tests directory
4.We can further subdive the tests directory into int and unit subdirectories to represent integration and unit tests respectively.
5.To run all the test suites we run the npm test
6.To run / execute a specific test suite we use the npm test -- tests /subdirectories/test suite file e.g:
npm test -- tests/int/api to perform api integration tests using the tests/int/api.test.js test suite

What is a unit test?
Is a verification of the functionality of a particular unit in a code or program. This commonly refers to testing a particular function.

*What is an integration test?
Is a verification of the functionality of different units or functions that depend on each other. This commonly refers to testing two or more functions 
that rely /depend on each other.

*There are many other tests especially eze or end to end or ui tests, acceptance tests etc..
